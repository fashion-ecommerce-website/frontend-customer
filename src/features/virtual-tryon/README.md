## API Integration

### Current Implementation
âœ… **Fully integrated with Fitroom Virtual Try-On API**

The feature uses [Fitroom's AI-powered virtual try-on service](https://platform.fitroom.app) with real-time processing.

### Implementation Details

1. **API Service** (`src/services/api/virtualTryOnApi.ts`)
   - `VirtualTryOnApiService` class handles Fitroom API communication
   - Task-based processing with polling mechanism
   - Type-safe with comprehensive error handling

2. **Next.js API Routes** (`src/app/api/virtual-tryon/route.ts`)
   - Server-side endpoints for secure API key management
   - POST `/api/virtual-tryon` - Creates virtual try-on task
   - GET `/api/virtual-tryon?taskId=xxx` - Checks task status

3. **Container Logic** (`containers/VirtualTryOnContainer.tsx`)
   - Converts user and product images to proper format
   - Creates task via internal API
   - Polls for completion (2-second intervals, 2-minute timeout)
   - Displays result or error message

### Configuration

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
FITROOM_API_KEY=your_fitroom_api_key
FITROOM_STATUS_API_KEY=your_fitroom_status_api_key
```

See `FITROOM_INTEGRATION.md` in the project root for complete setup instructions.

## Styling
The feature uses Tailwind CSS with:
- Gradient accents (purple-indigo)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Shadow and border utilities
- Animation utilities for loading states

## Error Handling
- File size validation (max 10MB)
- File type validation (images only)
- API error handling with user-friendly messages
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly error messages

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multiple product try-on (layering)
- [ ] Save try-on results to profile
- [ ] Share results on social media
- [ ] AR try-on using device camera
- [ ] Video-based try-on
- [ ] Body measurements integration
- [ ] Size recommendation based on try-on

## Testing
To test the feature:
1. Add products to cart
2. Navigate to `/cart`
3. Click "Try On Before You Buy" button
4. Select a product
5. Upload an image
6. Click "Try On Now"
7. View the simulated result

## Dependencies
- Next.js (routing, navigation)
- React (UI components)
- Redux (cart state management)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Embla Carousel (product carousel)

## Notes
- Images are processed client-side for now
- API integration required for production use
- Consider implementing caching for processed results
- Monitor API usage and costs when integrated
